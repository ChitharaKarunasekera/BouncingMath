# BouncingMath
This repository contains a console Math Game developed in python. The game consists of three levels namely Easy, Medium, and Hard. In addition to that,  there is  another option as Quick game. This project was done for one of my cource work.

## Quick Game.
Quick game which is a game play mode, needs to provide five addition questions in the range 
of zero to ten. Once the player has provided answers it needs to display the playerâ€™s 
performance. This game mode has to be activated once the user selects this mode. 
To do this, functions of this mode can be coded in a separate package. Therefore, a package 
named Quickgame is created. This package consists of one module which includes five 
functions.
